## Customer Segmentation Analysis :shipit:

In this project, we are going to work with the **_UCI - Online Retail_** dataset, a transnational data set which contains the data related to the transactions of customers for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.

We are going to extended the RFM model definition to a database of customer transactions and the type of customer of online retail industry. The methodology is applying RFM model with K-means clustering to determine customer type. Consequently, the customer type will be brought into co-consideration with the RFM principles to make it even practical customers and their segmentation.

Project instructor will walk you through these steps:

1. Importing Online Retail dataset and preparing it for the analysis.

2. Deciding on and calculating key data points for our analysis - RFM Model
- [What is RFM Model?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFM_(market_research) "RFM - Market Reseach")
- [Using RFM to Identify Your Best Customers](https://www.eightleaves.com/2011/01/using-rfm-to-identify-your-best-customers/ "Using RFM to Identify Your Best Customers")
3. Determining the number of clusters in a data set and fitting model
- [Elbow method (clustering)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_method_(clustering))
- [K-Means Clustering algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)

4. Evaluating & Visualizing our analysis results using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
